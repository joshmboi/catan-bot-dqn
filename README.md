# Repository for Catan Bot
First iteration of creating a Catan Bot. The goal is to create a Deep-Q Neural Network to play Catan.

## Limitations of 1st Iteration:
- Random Starting Positions (arguably the most important decisions a player makes)
- One trade offer per round (limits the action space of the DQN - includes trading with the bank)
- 4 player games (this is the general method of play)

## Steps
- [] Implement Catan ("Optimized" for self play and RL)
- [] Create DQN

## Future Plans:
- Implement a Hierarchichal DQN structure (I have to read more papers about the concept before implementing)
